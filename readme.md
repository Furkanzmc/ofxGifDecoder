# ofxGifDecoder
an addon to decode animated gif files in openframeworks. 

given a file, it'll process it and allow to draw the gif, draw the frames, get frame duration info, get the gif palette, etc.

it has basic functionality and it's not fully tested, but it works.

both this and ofxGifEncoder will probably be merged soon into ofxGif.
